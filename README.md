# Visual Basic Script for Stock Data
#### This is a script written in vba used to analyze stock data in an excel spreadsheet. 
#### New columns are created to calculate and record values such as "Yearly Change", "Percent Change", and "Total Stock Volume"
#### A smaller dataset was used to test the script to finally use it on a significantly larger set. (from ~5mb to ~75mb)
